SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The underlying ideas behind the OneNoteUtilitiesGraph module.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of the OneNoteUtilitiesGraph module is to allow programmatic access to
    information stored in the cloud version of OneNote. This includes both the structure
    of the OneNote data (NoteBooks, SectionsGroups, Sections, Pages) but also the page contents
    themselves as structured XHTML data. The idea is to allow automation of tasks that are 
    time-consuming using the User Interface and to possibly allow integration with other
    apps and services.

    OneNoteUtilitiesGraph is designed to be used both from within scripts and also from
    the command line.
